# CNN for Hand Gestures Recognition with pytorch
This repo contains the code for classifying customized hand gestures using cnn. The hand gestures are designed for Human-Robot Interaction in some special scenes (e.g. outer space).

## Dependencies
This code requires the following: 
* python 3.7.6
* pytorch 1.7.1
* torchvision 0.8.2
